Welding fixture designed for accurate and repeatable fabrication of a 90° T-joint between two square tubes  
(50×50×150 mm and 50×50×200 mm). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 1. Project Overview  

This project presents a compact welding fixture that holds two square hollow sections (SHS) in a precise T-joint while providing:

- Accurate positioning and alignment  
- Easy loading and unloading of workpieces  
- Clear welding access around the joint  
- Resistance to thermal distortion during welding  
- Quick clamping using standard toggle clamps :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

The fixture was modelled in **SolidWorks**.

## 2. Problem Statement  

Design a compact, practical welding fixture to hold:

- Tube 1: 50×50×150 mm SHS  
- Tube 2: 50×50×200 mm SHS  

in a perfect T-configuration, ensuring:

- Proper squareness (90° joint)  
- Repeatable positioning across multiple parts  
- Protection of clamps and fixture from welding heat  
- Simple operation suitable for workshop use :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

---

## 3. Design Objectives  

- Hold both tubes rigidly during welding using quick-action toggle clamps  
- Maintain dimensional accuracy and repeatability of the T-joint  
- Provide thermal protection to clamps and base using wear blocks, air gaps and insulating pads  
- Use standard, easily available materials and components  
- Keep the design modular for easy assembly, adjustment and maintenance :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## 4. Fixture Concept and Features  

The final fixture consists of:

- **Base Plate** – Rigid foundation supporting the entire fixture  
- **Angle Brackets and Vertical Support Frame** – Hold the vertical SHS and define the T-joint position  
- **Wear Blocks / Support Blocks** – Elevate the tubes, provide support and isolate heat  
- **Toggle Clamps (3 units)**  
  - Two clamps on the horizontal tube side  
  - One clamp on the vertical tube support  
- **Thermal Insulating Pads** under clamps and support blocks  
- **Air Gap Zone** below the SHS tubes to reduce direct heat transfer :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

Key features:

- Precise T-joint holding for 50×50 SHS  
- Fast clamping and unclamping using toggle clamps  
- Stable, repeatable support by wear blocks and dowel pins  
- Heat-resistant design with insulating pads and air gaps  
- Modular layout, easy to assemble and adjust on the base plate :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

## 5. Clamping and Working Principle  

Clamping sequence:

1. Place the vertical SHS on the support frame and wear blocks.  
2. Place the horizontal SHS on the base-side wear blocks to form the T-joint.  
3. Engage the two side toggle clamps to lock the horizontal tube.  
4. Engage the toggle clamp mounted on the vertical support to lock the vertical tube.  

With all three clamps locked:

- The T-joint is fixed in position at 90°.  
- An air gap beneath the tubes reduces heat transfer to the base.  
- Welding access is available from both sides of the joint. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

## 6. Thermal and Operational Stability  

Design provisions for heat management:

- **Thermal Insulating Pads** (ceramic fiber board) under clamps and support blocks  
  - Protect clamps from welding heat  
  - Prevent warping of the base and fixture  

- **Air Gap Zone** below the SHS tubes  
  - Minimizes direct heat conduction to the base plate  
  - Improves fixture stability during high-temperature welding  

- **Removable Wear Blocks**  
  - Isolate heat from the main fixture  
  - Can be replaced when worn out  

- **Dowel Pins**  
  - Ensure repeatable positioning of parts and wear blocks across batches :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
